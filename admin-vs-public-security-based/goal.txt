A {jetty.base} configured for
 * 1 connector
   + port 9090
 * 2 webapps
   + admin.war  on /admin
   + public.war on /public

the admin.war has the following WEB-INF/web.xml section

    <auth-method>BASIC</auth-method>
    <realm-name>Admin Realm</realm-name>
  </login-config>
  <security-constraint>
    <web-resource-collection>
      <web-resource-name>Protected Area</web-resource-name>
      <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    </web-resource-collection>
    <auth-constraint>
      <role-name>admin</role-name>

Goals
-----

Make sure that the server can start. (its currently broken)
Make sure that the /admin webapp has security.
Make sure that security at server side is properly configured.
Make sure that add a user called "bob" setup to access /admin

http://localhost:9090/admin     (Requires Auth)
http://localhost:9090/          (no auth)
http://localhost:9090/public    (no auth required)


Bonus Goal
----------

If a request arrives on path "/", auto-redirect to "/public"

so that http://localhost:9090/  becomes  http://localhost:9090/public
