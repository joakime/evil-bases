What you have
-------------

A {jetty.base} configured for
 * 1 connector on port 9090
 * 1 webapp - hello.war

Goals
-----

Make sure that the hello.war is deployed successfully.

Access the webapp main page.

http://localhost:9099/hello       (Shows index.html)

Now, try to hit the link for "/world.hello", it should not
be a 404 error.

Fix it, it only requires some proper jetty.base configuration.
But which one?


Bonus Goal
----------

Change the context path for hello.war to respond from "/"
So that the app shows the index.html from

  http://localhost:9090/

There are 2 ways to accomplish this, can you think of both ways?
