you can find the SPDY demo here:

https://github.com/jetty-project/spdy-demo

1) Clone it.
2) Make sure you have the right NPN version with the JDK you're using
in pom.xml.
3) Build it
4) mvn jetty:run-forked

mvn run-forked is important, mvn jetty:run won't work.

To make it evident, you need to run the simulate-rountrip.sh script
(Linux): it slows down the localhost interface to simulate the effects
of a roundtrip.

Watch the demo to see how I explained and what links to click when.

That should be all.
