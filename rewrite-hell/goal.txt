What you have
-------------

A {jetty.base} configured for
 * 2 connectors
   + on port 9090 (the main connector)
   + on port 9099 (the old connector)
 * 4 webapp contexts
   + / (aka ROOT)
   + /hello
   + /goodbye
   + /old

Goals
-----

There are a number of old and now outdated resources on this
server configuration, but you have old clients and bookmarks
that exist that will still use some of them.

Configure the rewrite rules (and only the rewrite rules) for
these requirements.

1) All access to http://localhost:9099/ should goto
   http://localhost:9090/
   + this should result in a 302 redirect with a new Location (URL)
   + this should preserve the path provided, such that if
       http://localhost:9099/hello/stuff.hello
     becomes a 302 redirect for
       http://localhost:9090/hello/stuff.hello
2) All requests to the context "/old/*" should goto "/hello" instead
   This should be done with a 302 redirect for the new path.
   + this should preserve the path provided.
3) All requests to the context "/goodbye/*" should goto "/hello" instead
   This should be done internally, and result in a hello message.
   + NO 302 REDIRECT should happen.


Bonus
-----

Copy the configuration from annotation-scanning-extraclasspath which
adds the support for url patterns of "*.goodbye".

Once you confirm that is working in this base, then make a regex
based rule that will convert those requests (internally, with no 302
redirect) to the "*.hello" equivalents
