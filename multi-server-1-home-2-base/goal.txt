What you have
-------------

Two {jetty.base} directories
 * base-a
 * base-b


Goals
-----

Run 2 servers (each in their own JVM)
Make sure that each server starts and can accept requests.
Make any changes you need to the configuration in the {jetty.base}
directories to allow both servers to exist at the same time.

Hint: you'll likely see a conflict / error when you start
the second server, what do you need to do resolve this conflict.
