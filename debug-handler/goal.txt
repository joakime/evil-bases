What you have
-------------

A {jetty.base} configured for
 * 1 connector on port 9090
 * 1 webapp - hello.war

Goals
-----

Make sure that the hello.war is deployed successfully.

Access the webapp main page.

http://localhost:9099/hello       (Shows index.html)

Now, try to hit the link for "/world.hello", it should not
be a 404 error.

Now hit http://localhost:9090/hello/cruel.goodbye

This should work, as that servlet exists in the
{jetty.base}/lib/goodbye.jar

Configure the hello app to add an extra classpath that includes
the goodbye.jar file
