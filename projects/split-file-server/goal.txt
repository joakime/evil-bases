What you have
-------------

An eclipse project configured for
 * 1 connector on port 9090
 * 3 contexts, all on contextPath "/"
   They will serve files (in a merged fashion)

Goals
-----

Load / Import project into Eclipse.
Run SplitFileServer.java as a java application in Eclipse.

Verify that you can access the various files at

http://localhost:9090/

The /test.txt exists in 2 places.
How would you adjust the embedded jetty server to see one version
of this test.txt versus the other?

The /monalisa.asc resource looks like html, but is being returned as
text.  Modify SplitFileServer to add a mime-type for *.asc that will
make the browser see it as HTML


Bonus Goal
----------

Add GzipHandler to the tree to enforce Gzip compression for the
following rules.

 * Files over 10k
 * No Gzip for image files
